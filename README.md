# School Project Requirement and Website Overview

This project is a responsive website that simulates battles between mythical creatures or gods, using AI and random terrain-based advantages to create dynamic results.
It was developed for a school assignment with the following requirements:

--Frontend built using Websim (or any web generator)
--Backend powered by Make.com
--Uses a database (RAG) to store creature data
--Integrates OpenRouter API via Make.com
--Responsive design – works on desktop and mobile
--Includes CoC and PKW logos
--Minimum of 2 web pages

# About the website

The site features a collection of mythical creatures and gods, each with their own stats stored in a database. Users can choose two creatures and simulate a battle between them.
What makes the simulation unique:

--AI-generated outcomes: Even with the same two creatures, the result can change every time.
--Terrain system: Users can pick a battleground (e.g., mountain, forest, ocean), which affects the stats and outcomes—some creatures gain advantages in certain terrains.
--This unpredictability gives the project a fun and interactive edge, encouraging users to experiment with different matchups.

# Tools Used

Frontend: Websim for building and hosting the UI
Backend automation: Make.com to handle API calls and database operations
Database: using DumplingAI as a RAG-based design
OpenRouter: for access the AI to use to generate battle narratives dynamically

# Challenges and What I Learned

--Classify the data that not true base on database that DumplingAI respond back to make the one that no use to trash
--End the process by using ERROR (by using http with non-exist url) to make the process end without doing anything more
